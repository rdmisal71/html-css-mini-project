					<h3>Israel declares LeT a terror outfit to mark 15th anniversary of 26/11 Mumbai attacks</h3>
					<p class="text">In a significant move to mark the 15th anniversary of the tragic Mumbai terror attacks, Israel has officially designated Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) as a terror organization. The Israeli Embassy said in a statement that all necessary procedures have been completed to declare LeT as a terror outfit, noting that the decision was made independently without any formal request from the Indian government.</p>

					<h3>Uttarakhand: First video of workers stuck inside collapsed Uttarkashi tunnel surfaces after ‘major breakthrough’</h3>

					<h3>Covid vaccine not responsible for sudden deaths among young adults in India: Study</h3>
					<p class="text">The study came amid reports of sudden deaths of young adults including popular Malayalam TV actor Dr Priya after suffering from a sudden cardiac arrest. Similar reports of sudden deaths among healthy adults in India raised concerns that they might be related to Covid-19 or the vaccination against the disease, which prompted researchers to carry out the study.</p>

					<h3>In this kerfuffle, no one is sure where OpenAI, Microsoft or Sam Altman stand</h3>
					<p class="text">If you expected a series of announcements yesterday may calm turbulent waters in the Silicon Valley, that hasn’t panned out as anticipated. If we are to summarise where things stand for now, it’s an attempt we must somehow make. Microsoft still doesn’t know if Sam Altman or Sam Brockman are indeed joining. All Satya Nadella could say in an interview with Bloomberg a few hours ago is, “they’re all in the process of joining”. A coup, which seemed akin to acquiring crucial parts of artificial intelligence start-up OpenAI for $0 and zero regulatory procedures, suddenly doesn’t really seem like one anymore.</p>
