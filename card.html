            <h3>Transitional shift or persist with old guard?</h3>
            <p>Especially in cricket, where the role of the captain extends beyond just turning up for the toss, most teams assume the character of their leader. Never was that more obvious than at the 2023 World Cup, when India fed off Rohit Sharma to establish themselves as an entertaining yet self-controlled outfit.</p>

            <h3>Chin up, Team India. World Cup or not</h3>
            <p>Ever been through a bad break-up? It's usually the morning after when the realisation that a relationship has indeed ended hits hard. Even the most committed morning person feels sick to his/her stomach. Everything around is just filthy, sloppy, icky. Go back to sleep if you want. It won't help. Memories come flooding back. You check your phone and nothing. All that's left is a huge void. It's nasty. With time, the wounds heal but the emptiness of that next morning is excruciatingly painful.</p>

            <h3>'India were the superior side. You ask anyone'</h3>
            <p>For 10 straight matches, India were an invincible force, whether it was with the batting or with the bowling. A third World Cup title seemed a certainty as most believed. But in the ultimate match, India stumbled. Most believed it was down to Australia being Australia, the team made for big matches and big occasions, the most dominant force ever in World Cup history. There have been umpteen analysis over the last two days pertaining to India's six-wicket loss, but you seldom can find a flaw in a team that won all their 10 previous games in the tournament which such supremacy, whether defending to chasing a score.</p>

            <h3>'Overconfidence aapko marwah deti hai'</h3>
            <p>After an incredible run of 10 straight wins - nine in the league stage and one in semis - India eventually crumbled in the one that mattered the most. Despite being the outright favourite for the World Cup final on the back of their dominating run and some brilliant individual performances, India lost by six wickets against Australia. Former Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi felt that the loss was down to sheer overconfidence as the razor-sharp remark went viral on social media.</p>
