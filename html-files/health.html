                    <h3>Ways by which social media can increase anxiety</h3>
                    <p>Social media connects the world and brings us closer to our loved ones, but it can also be the reason for anxiety and stress. "Have you ever noticed your anxiety heightens when you’ve just been on social media? Or perhaps while you’re scrolling?⁣ Social media-induced anxiety refers to the feelings of stress, anxiety, or distress that can arise from the use of social media platforms.⁣ If you use it on a regular basis you’re increasingly exposed to various types of content, such as curated profiles, highlight reels, news, and discussions, which can contribute to feelings of anxiety and unease," wrote Therapist Carolyn Rubenstein. Here are a few ways by which social media can increase anxiety.</p>

                    <p>To try and identify Alzheimer's risks earlier, researchers assessed the association between brain MRI volumes, as well as amyloid and tau uptake on positron emission tomography (PET) scans, with body mass index (BMI), obesity, insulin resistance and abdominal adipose (fatty) tissue in a cognitively normal midlife population. Amyloid and tau are proteins thought to interfere with the communication between brain cells.</p>

                    <h3>Behaviours that are not okay in any relationship</h3>
                    <p>Some behaviour patterns are unhealthy for any kind of relationship. Be it in family or friendship or in a romantic relationship, some behaviours can be extremely toxic anywhere. "If you’re someone who has a history of difficult relationships, you may have learned to cope by developing patterns that do not honor who you are in order to maintain the peace (or to not be alone). This can look like people-pleasing, avoiding bringing up tough issues, changing who you are, or tolerating behaviors that you absolutely should not be," wrote Therapist Sadaf Siddiqi. The expert further noted down a few behaviour patterns that are not acceptable in any relationship</p>

                    <h3>Dealing with grief: Experts shares tips</h3>
                    <p>Grief is an extremely personal feeling but is also very real. Often, we think if we suppress grief with other things and actions, we may never have to directly deal with it. But that's not true. Therapists Nicole Vignola and Sula Windgassen explained that grief activates the areas of the brain for pain processing and modulation leading to the sensation of pain feeling physical as well as mental. Norepinephrine is released which can make the body feel exhausted and restless, often leading to sleeplessness. We also visualise and replay the events over and over again and feel the same grief. However, the only way to get over grief is to keep replaying the events and let the brain do its work. These further aids the emotional processing of grief.</p>
